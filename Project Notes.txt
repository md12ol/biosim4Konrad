Minimally Viable Product
    >>	For the first goal we want to make it so that half of the creatures are classified as mice and half as cats
    >>	The mice would have the typical condition of needing to make it to one of the edges in order to reproduce
    >>	The cats would be able to kill and would have the condition that they need to kill a creature to reproduce
    >>	What would this require?
        >>	Enable killing
            >>	Make sure mice aren't able to kill
        >>	Add in the possibility of different types of creatures
            >>	Add in a parameter within the indiv class that keeps track of mice and cats
            >>  When generating the population
        >>	Mice NNs don't include the kill neuron
        >>	(Cats mights not have sufficient kill neurons in their initial population. If so we will need to ensure more (or all) cats include the kill neuron)
        >>	Modify the selection mechanism for cats to be that they killed something during the sim
        >>	Two separate new population generations: one for cats and one for mice
        >>	Add a parameter to cats so we know if they have killed something

Future goals
    >>	Pheromone released by mice that other mice can detect and follow
    >>	Cats also need to have come in contact with another cat to reproduce
    >>	Cats shouldn't be eating other cats
    >>	Mouse Changes
        >>	Mice need to have come in contact with another mouse to reproduce
        >>	Mice need to have eaten to reproduce
        >>	Add in food for mice
        >>	Neurons to detect food but only mice can have them?
    >>	Either modified neurons or new neurons that add in species information to the other sensors
    >>	Gender of the mice/cats

Notes
    >>	The entire population dies each generation
    >>  Gene Structure: each gene represents a single connection in the NN
        >>  1 bit: either from input sensory neuron (0) or an internal neuron (1)
        >>  7 bits: this number mod the number of neurons from the previous bit identifies the source neuron for the connection
        >>  1 bit: either to an output action neuron (0) or an internal neuron (1)
        >>  7 bits: this number mod the number of neurons from the previous bit identifies the destination neuron for the connection
        >>  16 bits: the weight of the connection
    >>  An individual's NN contains some number of neurons from the set of all possible neurons (21 sensory neurons, maxNumberNeurons internal neuron(s), and 11 action neurons).
    >>  Multiple Actions can be triggered for a single step
        >>  But only one movement for a single step is possible (depends on accumulated sum of all movement urges)
        >>  Movement is done after all other actions
        >>  Movement probability also depends on the responsiveness (gets multiplied with the sum of movement urges to decide the probability of movement in direction x or y)
        >>  e.g. (5.0, 5.0) adjusted by hyperbolic tangent function to (1.0, 1.0) multiplied with responsiveness 0.6 results in 60% chance of moving east and north respectively
    >>  When individual's spawn, their NN gets created from their genome
        >>  first a set of referenced neuron number is created, to keep track of their outputs
        >>  internal neurons without outputs or which only feed themselves get removed
        >>  remaining neurons get renumbered sequentially starting with 0
    >>  During a single simulation step, the sums of the inputs for each action neuron get calculated
    >>  then they get converted to a probability between 0 and 1 to be executed
    >>  not all action neurons are probability-based (for example responsiveness is set depending on the hyperbolic tangent of the input sum)

Stuff we Don't Understand
    >>  Can multiple actions be triggered for a single step?

January 30th 2026
    >>  Look into if multiple actions can be triggered for a single step?
    >>  Look into understanding the NN and how that generates action for the individual and explain this to Michael
