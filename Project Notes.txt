Minimally Viable Product
    >>	For the first goal we want to make it so that half of the creatures are classified as mice and half as cats
    >>	The mice would have the typical condition of needing to make it to one of the edges in order to reproduce
    >>	The cats would be able to kill and would have the condition that they need to kill a creature to reproduce
    >>	What would this require?
        >>	Enable killing
            >>	Make sure mice aren't able to kill
        >>	Add in the possibility of different types of creatures
            >>	Add in a parameter within the indiv class that keeps track of mice and cats
            >>  When generating the population
        >>	Mice NNs don't include the kill neuron
        >>	(Cats mights not have sufficient kill neurons in their initial population. If so we will need to ensure more (or all) cats include the kill neuron)
        >>	Modify the selection mechanism for cats to be that they killed something during the sim
        >>	Two seperate new population generations: one for cats and one for mice
        >>	Add a parameter to cats so we know if they have killed something

Future goals
    >>	Pheramone released by mice that other mice can detect and follow
    >>	Cats also need to have come in contact with another cat to reproduce
    >>	Cats shouldn't be eating other cats
    >>	Mouse Changes
        >>	Mice need to have come in contact with another mouse to reproduce
        >>	Mice need to have eaten to reproduce
        >>	Add in food for mice
        >>	Neurons to detect food but only mice can have them?
    >>	Either modified neurons or new neurons that add in species information to the other sensors
    >>	Gender of the mice/cats

Notes
    >>	The entire population dies each generation
    >>  Gene Structure: each gene represents a single connection in the NN
        >>  1 bit: either from input sensory neuron (0) or an internal neuron (1)
        >>  7 bits: this number mod the number of neurons from the previous bit identifies the source neuron for the connection
        >>  1 bit: either to an output action neuron (0) or an internal neuron (1)
        >>  7 bits: this number mod the number of neurons from the previous bit identifies the destination neuron for the connection
        >>  16 bits: the weight of the connection
    >>  An individual's NN contains some number of neurons from the set of all possible neurons (21 sensory neurons, maxNumberNeurons internal neuron(s), and 11 action neurons).

Stuff we Don't Understand
    >>  Can multiple actions be triggered for a single step?

    >>  Look into if multiple actions can be triggered for a single step?
    >>  Look into understanding the NN and how that generates action for the individual and explain this to Michael
